Perfect. This plan looks comprehensive and executable. The GameState interface matches the vanilla implementation exactly, the Three.js setup preserves all the specific settings (camera bounds, postprocessing pipeline, exact shader values), and the file structure is clean.
Proceed with Phase 1 implementation. Start with the project setup and work through the files in the order you listed:

Initialize the Vite project with exact dependencies
Create the folder structure
Implement useGameState with all 60+ state variables
Build useThreeScene with the exact vanilla rendering pipeline
Create useEntityPool for the object pooling system
Add all constants and utility functions

Make sure the gameConstants.ts file has ALL the exact values from the vanilla implementation - I saw additional constants like COMBO_TIMER (2.3), INVULN_SPAWN (2.0), INVULN_WAVE (3.0), etc. that should be included.
Begin implementation.
