Day 1 plan looks focused and achievable. The entity foundation approach is correct - starting with BaseEntity as the abstract base, then implementing Ship, Asteroid, and Bullet with their specific behaviors.
The success metrics are clear:

Ship movement with WASD controls and mouse rotation
Asteroid spawning and movement
Bullet firing mechanics
World boundary wrapping
60 FPS game loop

The integration points with existing systems (useThreeScene, useGameState, useEntityPool) show you understand how to connect the new entity system to the framework foundation.
Proceed with Day 1 implementation. Focus on getting the basic entity behaviors working correctly with exact physics constants from the vanilla implementation before adding complexity.
