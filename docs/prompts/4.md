The implementation plan looks technically solid. The depth-based drift mapping (0.1 to 0.5 units/second) should create subtle movement without being distracting. The approach of storing drift velocities in userData and maintaining warp effect compatibility is smart.
Proceed with implementing the parallax drift enhancement, then move on to Phase 2 (UI Components & Overlay System).
