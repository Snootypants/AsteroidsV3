This Phase 3 plan is comprehensive and well-structured. The entity hierarchy with BaseEntity as foundation, the modular systems architecture, and the 6-day implementation timeline show solid planning.
Key strengths:

Logical progression from foundation (entities) to integration (full game)
Clear separation of concerns (physics, collision, audio, input, VFX)
Success criteria are measurable and specific
File structure maintains the framework's modularity

The implementation order makes sense - getting basic entities and game loop working first, then adding combat mechanics, then advanced features and polish.
Proceed with Phase 3. Start with Day 1: Entity System foundation (BaseEntity, Ship, Asteroid, Bullet classes). Focus on getting basic movement and rendering working before adding complexity.
The goal is a fully playable asteroids game that matches the vanilla implementation's behavior exactly.
