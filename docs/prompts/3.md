This plan looks perfect. The depth-based parallax approach will create exactly the subtle "active space" feeling you want. The implementation is smart - using the existing rand utility, maintaining compatibility with the warp effect, and continuing drift during pause for atmosphere.
The technical approach is sound:

Storing drift velocities as userData
Mapping depth to drift speed (closer stars faster)
Proper wrapping at world bounds
Updating positions each frame with needsUpdate flag

Proceed with implementing this enhancement, then continue with Phase 2 (UI Components & Overlay System).
