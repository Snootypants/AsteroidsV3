Phase 2 UI framework completion looks comprehensive! Ready for Phase 3: Game Systems Integration.
Phase 3 should implement the core game mechanics and systems:
Phase 3: Game Systems Integration

Entity System - Implement the actual game entities (Ship, Asteroid, Bullet, Enemy, Pickup, Drone) using the entity pools and Three.js objects
Physics & Collision - Game loop with entity updates, collision detection, world wrapping, ship movement/shooting mechanics
Audio System - Web Audio API integration with the 9 SFX types from vanilla (shoot, hit, explode, shield, etc.)
Input Management - Keyboard/mouse handling, ship controls, reticle system, control mode switching
Particle & VFX - Integrate the ParticleSystem and DebrisSystem with game events (explosions, hits, engine trails)

The goal is to connect the UI framework from Phase 2 with actual playable game mechanics that match the vanilla implementation's behavior exactly. This should result in a fully functional asteroids game using the React framework.
Begin with the entity system and basic game loop. Use the reference vanilla implementation for exact physics values and entity behaviors.
