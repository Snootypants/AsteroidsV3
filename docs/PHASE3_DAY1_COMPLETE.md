# Phase 3 Day 1: Entity System Foundation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented the foundational entity system for the React Game Framework. All core entities are now functional with proper physics, rendering, and lifecycle management.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. **BaseEntity Abstract Class** (`/src/framework/entities/BaseEntity.ts`)
- Core properties: position, velocity, rotation, radius, age, active state
- Physics integration with delta time updates
- World wrapping logic for seamless boundaries  
- Circle-circle collision detection system
- Distance and direction calculations
- Force application mechanics
- Spawn/despawn lifecycle management
- Object pooling reset functionality

### 2. **Ship Entity** (`/src/framework/entities/Ship.ts`)
- Player ship with exact PLAYER constants:
  - Acceleration: 40, Max Speed: 40, Friction: 0.98, Turn Speed: 3.2
- Ship texture loading from assets (`/src/assets/ship/ship.png`)
- Smooth thrust mechanics with velocity integration
- Mouse-based rotation with smooth interpolation
- Shield visual with invulnerability system
- Boost flame effects with flicker animation
- Three-component visual system (ship, shield, flames)

### 3. **Asteroid Entity** (`/src/framework/entities/Asteroid.ts`)
- Three size variants with exact vanilla radii:
  - Large: 6, Medium: 3.5, Small: 2.0
- Procedural geometry generation with polar coordinates
- Random radius variation for irregular shapes
- Material variants for visual diversity (5 color variations)
- Continuous rotation with random speeds
- Split mechanics with proper inheritance
- Static factory method for wave-scaled spawning
- Proper geometry disposal to prevent memory leaks

### 4. **Bullet Entity** (`/src/framework/entities/Bullet.ts`)
- Cylinder geometry for line-like appearance
- Exact vanilla constants: Speed 70, Lifetime 1.1s, Radius 0.2
- Pierce and ricochet mechanics
- Visual indicators for special bullet types
- Lifetime-based fade effects
- Velocity inheritance from shooter
- Static factory method for modded bullets
- Proper orientation along movement direction

### 5. **EntityManager System** (`/src/framework/systems/EntityManager.ts`)
- Central entity registry and lifecycle management
- Object pooling for all entity types:
  - Ships: 5 pool size, Asteroids: 50, Bullets: 100
- Type-safe entity collections
- Automated inactive entity cleanup
- Pool statistics and debug information
- Spawn methods for all entity types
- Integration with Three.js scene management
- Performance-optimized update loops

### 6. **GameLoop System** (`/src/framework/game/GameLoop.ts`)
- RequestAnimationFrame integration
- Delta time calculation with 33ms clamping (30 FPS minimum)
- State-based update conditions (playing, not paused, etc.)
- Performance metrics tracking (FPS, frame time)
- Callback system for extensible game logic
- Start/stop/pause/resume control methods
- React hook integration (`useGameLoop`)
- Game state timer management

### 7. **Integration & Testing** (`/src/framework/test/EntitySystemTest.tsx`)
- Interactive entity system test component
- Ship spawning and WASD movement controls
- Mouse-based ship rotation
- Asteroid spawning with random properties
- Bullet firing with space key
- Real-time debug information display
- Performance metrics monitoring
- Entity pool statistics
- Integrated with main App (Press 1 for Entity Test)

## 🛠 Technical Achievements
